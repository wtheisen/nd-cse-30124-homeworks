The first thing that you pull out is a map of Long Island and the surrounding areas. The map also has a number of travel options you could use, depending on the location you're in. There's taxis of course, but you could also take the train (public transport, who knew). Additionally, several locations have outgoing flights and even ferries you could take.\n",

Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, you need to make sure you find the shortest route possible between the two, no sightseeing while you're out there on business. Thinking back to class, you reckon you could probably use some sort of shortest path algorithm, like `Dijkstras` to find the shortest path between Grand Central and the Estate. Luckily, after an absolutely staggering amount of painstaking research during his winter vaction to San Juan, the Chief has also collected geographically accurate travel times (in minutes) for each mode of travel, between each connected location, as an edge list.\n",
