We could compare our suspect data against the alias data, treating it as the ground-truth, and see if any of the suspects line up against the aliases! They were able to get statements from 4 of the 6 suspects, but unfortunately they need your help tracking down the other two. We need to gather more evidence if we're going to be able to figure out who's alibi doesn't hold up. You'll need to visit the two remaining suspects and convince them to give you their statements to get the rest of the needed evidence."
