As you start walk away and try to figure out how to get out to the estate (unfortunately the office said a blade was out of the question), you recall an algorithm that may be able to help you get to the estate! You could use a search or traversal algorithm to pick the most efficient path between the duck pond in Central Park and the Estate out on LI.\n",
