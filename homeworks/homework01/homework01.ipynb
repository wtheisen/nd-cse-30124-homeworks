This is because Dijkstra’s algorithm expands nodes purely in order of increasing path cost g(n), exploring until all shortest paths are guaranteed. In contrast, A* uses both the path cost g(n) and a heuristic estimate h(n) of the remaining distance. This heuristic guides the search toward the destination, reducing the amount of exploration.\n",
